                        <p>
                            Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned
                                        Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served
                                        with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian,
                                        Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12.15 items that
                                        they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed
                                        atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a
                                        meal any time of the day.

                            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
                                        who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of
                                        owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family
                                        recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
                                        marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu
                                        beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the
                                        Mediterranean region.
